Convention- Essential to read and Write code
Ex. Debug.LOg(transform.postion.x);
    Country.City(Country.City.street);
    
    Indenting code is not nessisary but organises the code visually so you can read it more easily. It helps see where your code blocks start
    and end. It helps especially if you are coding with other people so they can see what your doing. Another thing to help when working with
    your fellow coders is to comment. Even if its a single line it will help not only other coders but help youself so you can take notes of 
    what you did
    
    you need to us "//" so your done so it does not execute in your code
